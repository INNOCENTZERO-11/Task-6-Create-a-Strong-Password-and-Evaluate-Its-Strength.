# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.
Creating a strong password is your first line of defense online. It needs to be long (12+ characters), complex (mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols), and random (avoiding personal info or common words). Think of it like a secret, complex key.
Strong Passwords: Creation & Evaluation
This guide outlines the principles for creating robust passwords and how to assess their strength.

1. What Makes a Password Strong?
A strong password is your primary defense against unauthorized access. It should be:

Long: Aim for at least 12-16 characters; longer is always better.

Complex: Include a mix of uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!@#$%^&*).

Random: Avoid easily guessable information (names, dates, common words, keyboard patterns). Each password should be unique.

2. How to Create a Strong Password
Consider these methods:

Passphrase Method: Combine several unrelated words.

Example: BlueTree!90Soccer&Key

Acronym Method: Use the first letters of words from a memorable sentence, adding numbers and symbols.

Example: "My dog has fleas, but I love him anyway!" â†’ MdHfl,bIlhA!24

3. How to Evaluate Password Strength
Use reputable online tools to check your password's resilience. These tools estimate the time it would take to crack your password.

Recommended Tool: HowSecureIsMyPassword.net

What to Look For:

Input your password into the checker (it doesn't store it).

Aim for an estimated cracking time in the trillions of years. Anything less (seconds, minutes, days) indicates a weak password that needs strengthening.

4. Best Practices
Uniqueness: Never reuse passwords across different accounts.

Password Managers: Consider using a trusted password manager (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password) to securely store and generate complex, unique passwords.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA wherever possible for an added layer of security.
